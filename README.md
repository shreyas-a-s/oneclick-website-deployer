# One Click Website Deployer
Bash script to install and setup a basic working tripal website.

> [!IMPORTANT] Currently the deployer only supports Debian 11 and it's derivatives like Ubuntu 18.04. We are planning to support their newer versions and other linux distributions. But currently, it's advisable to use any of the derivatives of Debian 11 as the base for running our deployer.

# Features of the script
- Installs in sub directory in /var/www/html directory. This makes it easier to develop and manage different versions of the website.
- Installs stable version 7 of drupal.
- Installs fully developed version (currently [7.x-3.x](https://github.com/tripal/tripal/tree/7.x-3.x)) of tripal.

# Prerequisites
- A basic install of debian 11.
- It is better if the installation is new with no extra modification.

# Usage
Execute the following commands one by one from a terminal:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y
git clone https://github.com/shreyas-a-s/oneclick-website-deployer.git
cd oneclick-website-deployer/
./install.sh
```
OR use this single line command from a terminal:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y && git clone https://github.com/shreyas-a-s/oneclick-website-deployer.git && cd oneclick-website-deployer/ && ./install.sh
```
OR if you want the simplest way:
```
Go to Releases section. Download deployer.zip from latest release. Extract it. Right click the install.sh file and click "Run as a Program" and follow the prompts.
```
> [!NOTE] In some systems, right click menu might not have this option. In that case, just double click the file and select "Run in Terminal".
